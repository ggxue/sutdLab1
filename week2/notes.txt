start both oscent and kali with host-only adapter for homework

// find server:
nmap -sP 192.168.56.0/24


// plain -> key(change everytime) -> cipher

// q5: ceaser question:
the key is between 0 to 128 (because ceaser cipher just shifting of bits only)

* there is only 1 correct plain text , just the key and cipher text changing everytime
* so can try to decrypt the first 20 character to reavel the first portion of the plain text
* readability check

brute force 128 times for each iteration to crack part by part
lock the readable plain text while decrypting
decrypt and lock the text from front to end part by part and send to server.

what library to bench mark the readable plain txt? some python natural language library to bench mark


// q6: Frequency Analysis of Substitution cipher

1. unhex 
2. build frequency table
3. swap in frequency table

* answer text are all lowser case letters with 9 character symbols only

// q7: stream cipher


// just write implementation for c , s , o in code then submit the python file for this week homework
